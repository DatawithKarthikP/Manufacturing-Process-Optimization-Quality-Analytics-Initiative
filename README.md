# 🏭 Manufacturing Process Optimization & Quality Analytics Initiative

This project demonstrates how to use **Python** for optimizing manufacturing operations and analyzing production quality using simulated factory data. It focuses on **key performance indicators (KPIs)** such as production time, defect rates, downtime, and yield performance, helping decision-makers identify process improvements and reduce waste.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze production performance across machines and operators
- Track and minimize defects and downtime
- Evaluate yield rates and operator efficiency
- Generate business-ready visualizations and KPI dashboards

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook / Python script** – Analysis execution

---

## 📊 Key KPIs Calculated

| KPI | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Average Production Time** | Time taken to complete batches by machine |
| **Defect Rate** | Ratio of defective units to total units per machine |
| **Downtime Analysis** | Average unproductive time per machine |
| **Yield Rate** | Percentage of non-defective units |
| **Operator Efficiency** | Yield performance per operator |
